# Knight Moves Pathfinding

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the knightMoves function, which calculates the shortest path a knight can take on a chessboard from a given starting position to a specified ending position. Utilizing a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, the function explores all possible knight moves while efficiently tracking visited positions to avoid cycles. The implementation is designed to return the complete path taken by the knight, represented as an array of coordinates. This project serves as a practical example of pathfinding algorithms and can be easily integrated into larger chess-related applications or used for educational purposes in algorithm studies.
